                <br /> Dear Best Friend, I don't know how to thank you but I'm Lucky to have you in my Life💗.<br />If ever there is a tomorrow when we're not together, there is something you must always remember. You are brave than you believe, stronger
                than ypu seem and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we are apart, I'll always be with you💕. You're not just a friend, you're like family to me. Having you as a friend is one of the best part of my life.
                You have a wonderful heart and a beautiful soul, and I am so proud to call my best friend🥰💟. <br />
